    CricShot is a blockchain-based platform that allows fans to buy, sell and trade numbered versions of specific NFTs through OpenSea by deploying them on nft.storage of Filecoin, video highlights of IPL and some more major tournaments. Once you purchase an NFT, those highlights go into your encrypted, secure highlight wallet to be "showcased" or re-sold on OpenSea.

Right after a match ends, CricShot mints new NFTs on Polygon Network which will be done season to season.

CricShot, besides a NFT minter, is also a multi-purpose Twitter bot that can trade the best moments of cricket world besides pushing forward the user engagement of a decentralized ecosystem through portraying virtual moments, powered by Polygon Network.

Also, CricShot Twitter bot is here to automate tasks for you the really cool thing about our NFT giveaways is that it actually picks "RANDOM" users using the ChainLink's VRF, to spice up, after processing the random number from the API, we are allocating them onto a dictionary object containing tokenIDs of NFT, which through the processed number, will be eligible to take it away, dope isn’t it? To put the verifiable randomness of blockchain to use.
